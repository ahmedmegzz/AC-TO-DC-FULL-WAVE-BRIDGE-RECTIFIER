# AC-TO-DC-FULL-WAVE-BRIDGE-RECTIFIER
In this project, I designed, simulated, and implemented a single-phase AC to DC full-wave bridge rectifier. The goal was to convert a 220V AC input into a stable 12V DC output, illustrating key concepts of power electronics.

Project Steps:

Theoretical Analysis: Conducted initial analysis to understand the rectifierâ€™s behavior.
Component Selection: Chose components including a 220V to 12V step-down transformer, diodes, and smoothing capacitors.
Simulation: Used MATLAB Simulink to simulate the rectifier circuit and verify its functionality and performance.
Practical Implementation: Assembled the circuit on a breadboard and tested its functionality.
PCB Design: Designed a printed circuit board (PCB) using EasyEDA, focusing on optimal layout and reducing noise.
Testing: Fabricated the PCB, connected it to the transformer and a 220V AC supply, and achieved a stable 12V DC output that met design specifications.
